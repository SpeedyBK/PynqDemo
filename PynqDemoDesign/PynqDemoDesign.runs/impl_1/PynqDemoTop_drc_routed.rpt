PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Menu/Selector/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Menu/Selector/name_arr_reg[1][name_ptr][2]_i_1/O, cell Menu/Selector/name_arr_reg[1][name_ptr][2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Menu/Selector/count_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Menu/Selector/name_arr[0][name_len][-1111111108]_i_2/O, cell Menu/Selector/name_arr[0][name_len][-1111111108]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
